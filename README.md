Testing applications with the openai.  Current goal is to get a UI that helps tweak microphone input.


# TODO - Future Plans

# GUI Phase
Create Tkinter GUI

Input Method Tab (Switch one on and all others go off or on)
-Press/Hold
-Keyword
-Toggle

Microphone Settings Tab
-Adjust all the microphone input parameters
-Sample rate, timeout, etc
-Min/max value and click/drag bar?

Try Sphinx for keyword recognition because speed > accuracy at that point

Voice Settings tab
- Leave blank for now
Ai Settings tab
-Change reponse behaviors
-Change prompts for different AIs

API tab
- Save API keys

How can I make setting persist between runnings?

# AI Phase
Fine tune Ai settings and how it responds

# Voice Phase
Fine tune voice setyle and voice settings
Create custom voice?

# Bots
This is indepedent of voices.  It's using the AI api style
Find host
Discord Bot
GroupMe Bot

Restructure project - right now I'm just using multiple testing files
